# July 21: Start!
I wired up all the keys for the matrix, picked a button(its like very cheap on JLCPCB)
Worried about what IO expander to use.
Will probably use a MCP one aaa i forgot the name
might change the layout - its at 10 9 10 10 rows rn
might change to 4x10 keys later?
not sure i'm a bit tired.
it also has arrow keys now yay!
sorry if this is confusing im in a bit of a hurry :Sob:
